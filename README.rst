CrudMiner
=========

The idea of CrudMiner came from having inherited a large webserver full
of user-installed software. As it is nearly always the case, when
clients are allowed to install their own software, they never actually
bother to keep it patched and updated. I wrote CrudMiner with the sole
task of looking for known-outdated web software and reporting it to me
in a format that was easy to grok and process.
