- Distinction between critical and non-critical vulnerabilities
  - Who says what is critical?
  - A lot more extra work!

- For projects like phpldapadmin that only have a VERSION file, I'll need to
  add an option to list another file to query and match. E.g.:

  path     = /VERSION
  regex    = RELEASE-(.*)
  andpath  = /index.php
  andregex = @package\s*phpLDAPAdmin
