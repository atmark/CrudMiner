- Distinction between critical and non-critical vulnerabilities
  - Who says what is critical?
  - A lot more extra work!

- For projects like phpldapadmin that only have a VERSION file, I'll need to
  add an option to list another file to query and match. E.g.:

  path     = /VERSION
  regex    = RELEASE-(.*)
  andpath  = /index.php
  andregex = @package\s*phpLDAPAdmin

  Target: 0.4.0

- Make --do-not-nag less blunt, by using an upper-ceiling date. This way if
  someone says "thanks for letting me know, we will implement this by the end
  of next month", you could do:
  
  crudminer --do-not-nag /path/to/their/stuff 2011-12-31

  Target: 0.4.0
  Migration: add a "do_not_nag_until" column and ignore the "do_not_nag"
             column if found. Any existing entries with non-zero value in
             do_not_nag can be converted to today+1 year.
